# uwb
Python software for Ultra-Wideband ranging tests, using the Decawave DWM1000
See the [Iosoft Blog](https://iosoft.blog/real-time-location-ultra-wideband/) for details.

There are complex rules about which frequencies can be used for Ultra-Wideband (UWB), the permissible power-levels, and the transmit repetition-rate. So it is possible that the RF emissions generated by this software are not permitted in your locality. If in doubt, consult a suitably-qualified RF engineer before doing any UWB testing.
